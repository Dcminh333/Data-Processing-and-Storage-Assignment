## Personal Thoughts

Personally, I feel like the assignment is trivial in terms of trying to learn databases. The concept is easy to understand and easy to follow through on, but I personally think it should be structed to a specific database language rather just in general. From the instructions, it made it seem like it was an extremely general assignment and that through implementation I did not need to learn any other programming concepts out of my range. From a assignment stand point its a great refresh if your programming needs to be cleaned up.
